# Shinybased-GeneIDConversion-WebTool
A gene ID conversion web tool based on Shiny.

This tool allow you to update a gene list with gene in *.txt or *.csv foramt, and the symbols will be converted to ENTREZID, ENSEMBL, UNIGENE, UNIPROT, and GENENAME.

Of course you can edit the code to change the annotation package or input/output gene ID type, and don't forget use `AnnotationDbi::colums` to check.

When you've finished uploading, it will look like this:
